## Module 4: NoSQL Integration with MongoDB

In Module 4, we transitioned from static JSON files to a live NoSQL database using **MongoDB**. This marked a critical milestone in the full stack development of the Travlr Getaways application.

### Key Updates:
- Installed and configured **Mongoose** for MongoDB interaction.
- Created a **Mongoose schema** (`travlr.js`) to define and validate trip data.
- Developed a **database connection module** (`db.js`) to manage MongoDB connectivity.
- Built a **seeding script** (`seed.js`) to populate the database with initial trip records.
- Verified successful seeding through **MongoDB Compass**.

These updates ensure that the application now leverages a dynamic, queryable database, preparing it for full API integration and future CRUD operations.
