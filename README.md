Module 4: NoSQL Integration with MongoDB
In Module 4, we transitioned from static JSON files to a live NoSQL database using MongoDB. This marked a critical milestone in the full stack development of the Travlr Getaways application.

Key Updates:
Installed and configured Mongoose for database interaction.

Created a Mongoose schema (travlr.js) to define and validate trip data.

Populated the MongoDB collection (trips) using a custom seed script (seed.js).

Verified data insertion through MongoDB Compass.

Established a modular connection script (db.js) to manage MongoDB connectivity.

These changes ensure that the application is now backed by a dynamic, queryable database, laying the foundation for robust API interactions in upcoming modules.
